We realize the transformation between IEEE1471-2000 and MoDAF-AV.
The IEEE1471 committee precises a recommended practice for the design and the analysis of Architecture of Software Intensive Systems.
It fixes a terminolgy for System, Architecture, Architectural Description, Stakeholder, Concerns, View ,and Viewpoints concepts.
MoDAF (Ministry of Defense Architecture Framework) is based on the DoDAF (Departement of Defense Architecture Framework).
DoDAF is a framework to design C4ISR systems. MoDAF-AV (Architecture View) used several concepts defined in the IEEE1471.
It is the reason why we decide to make a transformation between IEEE1471 and MoDAF-AV.
For this we realize metamodels in km3 that are interpretations of the IEEE1471 Conceptual Model and the MoDAF Architecture View.
Now, we are implementing a ATL transformation between them.
